1. Starting with HTML/CSS:
a) https://dash.generalassemb.ly/: General Assembly’s free introduction to HTML/CSS and JavaScript. A nice project based platform, 
where you will have some interesting personal and business websites when you finish. You’ll need to do a lot more to be proficient,
however. If you’re not sure if you would like to code this is a good place to start, then move on to Freecodecamp or Udacity. 

b) https://www.freecodecamp.org/: Learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview preparation for developer jobs, 
thousands of students on chat and in Sydney a learning group that meets each Sunday.  
Sign up at: https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Volunteer-Programmers/ 
I highly recommend studying in a group, solo learning usually has a dropout rate over 80%, but as a group that changes.
To be part of this group you will need to also sign up for the online course at: FreeCodeCamp.Org 

c). https://www.udacity.com/courses/all : Free courses as well as a paid for programs with nano-degrees on completion. Good quality content.

d) https://wibit.net : More talk than chalk, but has very good overviews on what it means to be a developer and the background to programming languages.
